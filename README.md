Whack-a-Mole Game

A fun and interactive Whack-a-Mole game developed for Android. This game allows the user to "whack" moles (represented by different images) that randomly appear on a 3x3 grid. The game keeps track of the time and score, providing an exciting challenge to the player. The player’s objective is to score points by hitting the "devil fruit" moles and avoid the "head" moles, which cost the player points.
